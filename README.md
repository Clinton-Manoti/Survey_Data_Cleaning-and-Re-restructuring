# Survey_Data_Cleaning-and-Re-restructuring
 

# In this project I got to work on concepts such as pandas' merge and melt methods. The DataFrame was in a wide format and managed to change it into a long format. I also had to merge the different spreadsheets to form my main DataFrame. I managed to drop columns that were redundant and rename them appropriately. 

# The questions that got answered included the number of respondents for each survey question asked and the number of respondents who had same answers for the questions asked.
